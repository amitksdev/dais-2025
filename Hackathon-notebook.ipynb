However, the `find_places_by_keyword` tool is not returning any results. I will provide a summary based on the initial search results for the US.\n\nThe initial search results for \"US\" include:\n- 13 Market St, Wilmington\n- Sports Page, Mountain View\n- Empire State Building, New York\n- Levain Bakery â€“ NoHo, NYC, New York\n- Milano's Bar, New York\n\nWhile these places may not be explicitly listed as family-friendly, some of them could be suitable for families. For example, the Empire State Building is a popular tourist destination that can be family-friendly.\n\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: Based on the available information, here are some places in the US that could be considered for families: \n1. Empire State Building, New York - A popular tourist destination.\n2. Sports Page, Mountain View - Could be a sports-related venue that might be of interest to families.\nThe other places listed, like bakeries and bars, may or may not be family-friendly depending on their specific nature (e.g., Levain Bakery could be suitable if they have kid-friendly food options, but Milano's Bar is less likely to be family-friendly due to its nature as a bar).\n\nFor a more accurate list of family-friendly places, consider searching for specific attractions like theme parks, museums, or national parks within the US.\u001B[0m\n\n\u001B[1m> Finished chain.\u001B[0m\n\n\n--- Final Answer ---\nBased on the available information, here are some places in the US that could be considered for families: \n1.
